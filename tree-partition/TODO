- Greedy Edge Selection
    [Done] Basic logic
    [Done] Sort by weight
	[] Fancier getOtherNeighborColors(). Now it's way slower than Greedy Tree
	   Growing
	[] Put a cap on # of nodes in each tree

- Greedy Tree Growing 
    [Done] Sort by weight
    [] Sort by something in the paper
    [] Prevent same vertices to be added multiple times to the queue
    [Done] Debug grid_15.in 
           14.in runs super fast but 15.in got stuck forever. 
           (Queue size too small. fixed)
	[Working] Put a cap on # of nodes in each tree

- Main
    [Done] Sort each output tree by node id.
